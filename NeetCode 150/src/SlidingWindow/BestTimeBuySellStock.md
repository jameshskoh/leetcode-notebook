You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

Examples:
```
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
* `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

Solution
