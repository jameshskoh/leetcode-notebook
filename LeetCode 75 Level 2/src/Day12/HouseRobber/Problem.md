You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.



Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.



#### Examples

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 4
Explanation: House 1 + house 3: 1 + 3 = 4

Input: nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
Output: 12
Explanation: House 1 + House 3 + House 5: 2 + 9 + 1 = 12
```



#### Constraints

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`
