 A collection of the LeetCode problems I solved.



## Procedures

* The following are the procedures that I should follow when solving a coding problem.



1. Ask questions
   1. To tease out the relevant assumptions
   2. To tease out the problem scope
   3. To know what a solution should look like
2. Work through an example
   1. Especially those with special cases
   2. Discover potential obstacles
   3. Add more assumptions and constraints
3. Build an initial solution
   1. It does not matter if it is naive or not
4. Test the solution
   1. Test with normal inputs
   2. Test with special inputs
   3. Evaluate its performance and decide trade-offs
5. Iterate through your solution
   1. Try to get a better solution
   2. The interviewer might guide you through the process
6. Implement the code
7. Walk through and test your implementation
   1. Test with normal inputs
   2. Test with special inputs
